Create a Git Worktree.

You can define files to copy into the newly created worktree. This is useful
for including files that are in your .gitignore (e.g., .env files) and thus not
tracked by the repository

To do this, create a configuration file named "$WORKTREE_DIR/.treerc" with an
environment variable called FILE_TO_COPY. This variable should be a list of
file paths that you want copied into the new worktree.

This script is mainly designed to automate the copying of such files, saving
you from having to do it manually each time.

All worktree directories are created under: "$WORKTREE_DIR"
The configuration file must be located at: "$WORKTREE_DIR/.treerc"

Syntax: $SCRIPT_NAME [-hb] <branch> <directory name>
Options:
    -h --help     Print this help and exit.
    -b --branch   Create branch
